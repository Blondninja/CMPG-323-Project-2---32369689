API DEVELOPMENT  PROJECT 2 
note* (i had a problem with my machine regarding the configuration and i have shared with Jacqui and Marijke they know it hence when used a diffrent pc it was showing the swagger output and when i test with mines it give configuration problem, in case if you have problems with it pliz take the lecturers in consideeration i have shared this with them and they suggested that i should use a diffrent machine)

purpose of the project:

you will create a CRUD RESTful API that will connect to a database storing
IoT device data. The API should contain at least one get, post, patch and delete method per
resource – aligning to the project's requirements. The RESTful API architecture has several
endpoints called over HTTP, invoking application code to update a database. 

The project is being scafold (dotnet ef) and therefore the models were being updated , the model have three categories namely category.cs , device.cs and zone.cs .
therefore one its being scafold the controllers is being added following up.

the controllers consist of Device , category ,zone and each of the controllers can output an GET METHOD, PUT METHOD , DELETE METHOD, POST METHODS. so that it can be hosted on the azure and output and thr swagger results.

we have used the gitignored so that the appsetting should not be accesed by the github, i have applied the authentification on the API and refrained the credentials from storing in the code 

the Api  and database is hosted on the azure and its has been granted access .

i have pushed the assignment on the github in case if i loose any data i can retrieve it from the github for backend purpose , and i have publish the project to the Azure and its publish successfully.

i have added 5 endpoints and made sure they are under owner
